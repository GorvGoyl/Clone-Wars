Get Started
Before start, please download the pretrained BigGAN at Google drive or Baidu cloud (password: uqtw), and put them to pretrained folder.

Example1: run image colorization example:

sh experiments/examples/run_colorization.sh   
The results will be saved in experiments/examples/images and experiments/examples/image_sheet.

Example2: process images with an image list:

sh experiments/examples/run_inpainting_list.sh   
Example3: evaluate on 1k ImageNet validation images via distributed training based on slurm:

# need to specifiy the root path of imagenet validate set in --root_dir
sh experiments/imagenet1k_128/colorization/train_slurm.sh   
Note:
- BigGAN needs a class condition as input. If no class condition is provided, it would be chosen from a set of random samples.
- The hyperparameters provided may not be optimal, feel free to tune them.
